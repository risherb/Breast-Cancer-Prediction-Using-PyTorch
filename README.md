# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-PyTorch
reast cancer prediction using PyTorch involves training a deep learning model to classify tumor types as malignant or benign. Leveraging datasets like the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, the model learns patterns from input features. PyTorch's flexibility and GPU acceleration help in optimizing the neural network for accurate predictions.
